🚀 Just Launched: A Creative & Comfortable News App! 📰✨

Super excited to share my latest project — a modern News App designed not just for functionality, but for a smooth and enjoyable user experience.

🎨 UI/UX First Approach

✅ Clean, eye-comfortable color scheme
✅ Smooth design for long reading sessions
✅ One-tap share button for social platforms
✅ Open any article directly in the browser
✅ Video news support for immersive updates

🧠 Tech Stack & Architecture

🔗 Ktor for API calls – future-ready with Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)
📦 Serializable for seamless JSON parsing
🏗️ Clean Architecture + MVVM – maintainable & scalable
🧭 Navigation 3 for safe & structured flow
📰 NewsDto for structured data handling

📱 This isn’t just an app – it’s a creative reimagination of how news should be consumed in 2025.
🌍 Cross-platform support coming soon. Excited to keep improving and adding more features!
